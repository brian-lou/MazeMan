Please note the Zoom recording framerate is low, so the FPS of the gameplay is low as well.

## Abstract
Our project is Maze-Man, an isometric Pac-Man-inspired rogue-like game built using Three.js. The game consists of three levels of increasing difficulty, and the objective is to defeat all the enemies/ghosts on each level. Colliding with ghosts head-on will decrease your HP, while attacking them from behind is safe. Level up to increase your stats and collect items to power up your character!
